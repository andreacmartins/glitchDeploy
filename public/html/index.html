<h1>A Beginner Full Stack Web Development Tutorial</h1>
<p>This is a ugly website right? That´s because it´s a tutorial being made by a beginner, for beginners. I want to teach myself how to do web development for personal projects, and i think that building web tutorial kills two birds with one stone, since i´m deploying something, beginning with the easy steps, and documenting all the way so that, by explaining, i can really understand what i´m doing.</p> 
<p>So, at first, whoever chooses to follow this tutorial will begin building the ugliest and non-responsive of websites, but <em>deployed</em> on the internet (not so easy as it seems) all to the way to where i want to get, that is, know the basics of enough tools to develop a "MVP-like" web app with authentication, payments that at least not ugly. I believe this to be  a <em>great</em> foundation to move on to the more advanced topics that will be necessary for the use case you are interested in.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal to is to learn by doing small steps that are as simple as possible and experimenting, in a fun and tactile way. Just like kids learn, and kids are great learners, aren´t they?</p>
<p>No experience needed, just knowing how to use a computer (word, excel) and basic math and english.</p>
<p>If that sounds good to you, keep going</p>
